# Image Classification using MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network to classify images from a dataset (such as MNIST or CIFAR-10).  
The MLP is trained to recognize and predict image classes based on pixel data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a standard image dataset (e.g., MNIST Handwritten Digits).  
Each image is flattened and passed into the MLP for training.

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. Data Preprocessing (normalization, train-test split)
2. Designing an **MLP architecture**
   - Input Layer
   - Hidden Layers with activation functions
   - Output Layer (softmax)
3. Training & Validation
4. Performance Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## 📊 Results
- Achieved good classification accuracy on test images.
- Demonstrated ability of MLP in image recognition tasks.
